# Hi there, I'm Pol Resina

I'm Pol Resina, a Data Scientist with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. Currently I'm studying Data Science & Engineering Bachelor's Degree at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC). 

Here are a few things I've been working on:

 ## üèéÔ∏èFormula StudentüèéÔ∏è

I've been working on a project with the UPC Formula Student Driverless team. We are developing a racing car to compete in the Formula Student competition. The car must be able to drive autonomously and complete a series of challenges. I'm in charge of the perception department: Using a LiDAR we have to make sure the car can detect cones on the track and immediately get the track limits. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDVeT7veqL8) to see the perception pipeline in action.

1. **Cone Detection System**

**Overview**: Ros package that detects cones in the track using a LiDAR. It's based on DBSCAN clustering algorithm to group the points that belong to the same cone. What's more, few optimizations have been added to improve driverless car's performance. The system is able to detect the cones and publish the position of each cone in the track. Compensation for the raw pointcloud data has been added to improve the detection of the cones.

**Tech used**: C++, ROS, PCL, DBSCAN


## üôã Personal Projects

1. **[US-CAR ACCIDENTS](https://github.com/pol-resina/US-Accidents)** 

**Overview**: Machine learning project to predict the severity of car accidents in the US. We have used a dataset with over 3 million records to train a model that can predict the severity of an accident based on the weather, road conditions, and other factors. Also, there is an intoductory part of data analysis and visualization. A report written in catalan is attached.

**Tech used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

**Keywords:** Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Classification.

2. **[HackUPC 2024 - Inditex Challenge: Street Style Decoder](https://github.com/gerard-grau/HackUPC2024)**

**Overview**: Developed a solution to identify duplicate or similar images within a dataset and built a clothing recommendation system that suggests outfits based on the user's input. Additionally, I developed an assistant system to help Inditex manage out-of-stock issues. For these tasks, I leveraged the pre-trained CLIP model to understand image context and used a U-NET model for semantic segmentation to detect and segment clothing items in images.

**Tech used:** Python, Pytorch, Huggingface, CLIP, U-NET, Semantic Segmentation

**Keywords:** Image Embedding, Contextual Understanding, Clothing Recommendation, Semantic Segmentation, FrontEnd

**Video Demo**: [Street Style Decoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=bP_nOEA_NqPDmRVg&v=62VR3V--_Sg&feature=youtu.be)

3. **[FANTASY FOOTBALL](https://github.com/polresi/Fantasy-Football)**

**Overview**:A program designed to derive the optimal football team composition from a collection of current players. It's mainly crafted with C++.

**Tech used:** C++, Python

**Keywords:** Optimization, Algorithms, Data Structures

4. **[CINEBUS](https://github.com/polresi/Cinebus)**

**Overview**: A desktop application that allows individuals to explore available movie showtimes and offers directions from their current whereabouts to the cinema, using the actual bus network in Barcelona.

**Tech used:** Python, Tkinter

**Keywords:** Optimization, Algorithms, Data Structures, GUI

5. **[DATATHON FME 2022 - Qualcomn Challenge: Chip Power Delivery](https://github.com/NIU1668278/Qualcomm-Challenge-)** 

**Overview**: Using a combination of Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing, we have devised a resolution for a modified version of the Traveling Salesman Problem.

**Tech used:** Python, Matplotlib

**Keywords:** Optimization, Algorithms, Data Structures, GUI

6. **[PASSWORD MANAGER](https://github.com/polresi/password_manager)**

**Overview**: My first project in Python. It's a password manager which is a software tool that securely stores all your passwords and other sensitive information in one place. It uses a master password to encrypt the data. The use

**Tech used:** Python, SQLite, Tkinter

**Keywords:** Data Security, GUI
